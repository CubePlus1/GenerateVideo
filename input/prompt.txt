A split-screen video call recording. In the larger, bottom-left frame, the calico and white cat from the reference image, still on the bed with the patterned blanket, is now energetically dancing on its back. Its hind legs are kicking rhythmically in the air, and its front paws are waving wildly. In the smaller, top-right frame, the white cat from the reference image remains in its original position, staring with the same wide-eyed, open-mouthed, completely bewildered expression at the dancing cat. The background of the bedroom with the dresser and TV remains visible in the main frame. The video should have a playful, homemade feel.
